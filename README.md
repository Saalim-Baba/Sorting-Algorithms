# 🌀 Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms**! This repository covers fundamental sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Dive into the code and explore how these algorithms work.

## 📚 Contents

### 1. Quicksort
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array into sub-arrays based on a pivot element.

### 2. Bubblesort
Bubblesort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 3. Heapsort
Heapsort is based on a binary heap data structure. It involves building a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and rebuilding the heap.

### 4. Shaker Sort
Shaker Sort, also known as Cocktail Shaker Sort, is a variation of Bubblesort. It sorts the array in both directions on each pass through the list.

## 🚀 Getting Started
